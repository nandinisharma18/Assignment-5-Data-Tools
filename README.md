# Assignment-5-Data-Tools

Neural Networks is a category of machine learning that tries to emulate the learning behavior of the real biological neural networks. Neural networks in the biological point of view have neurons with dendrites which receives input and using its axon it produces an output signal to another neuron. We will attempt to duplicate this through the use of a class of algorithms known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which will be abbreviated to neural networks. Neural networks creation process is divided into steps where one has to start from the least complex type of neural network which is the single perceptron.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will guide you to get this project running on your local machine. Ideally, the students should already have some level of programming competency, with Python being a desirable programming language. I have provided you with guidelines on how to deploy the project in a live system in the deployment section of this document.

### Prerequisites

What things do you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1. GIT (Optional)
2. ANACONDA NAVIGATOR
3. DATASET TO RUN THE NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get the environment running

1. Go to the website https:> //www.anaconda.com/download/success
2. Get the installer package based on your operating system of choice, which can be either Windows, Linux or macOS.
3. After this step, it is important to install the software that you have downloaded.
4. Click on the icon and launch the Anaconda application from your startup menu and select jupyter notebook from the options that appear.
5. Otherwise, users can enter ‘Jupyter Notebook’ into the search engine on the search bar of the operating system and then open it.

## Running the code

1. Use a clone command that is Git clone “the web URL” available by going to the Code option as a dropdown button.
2. The user can also choose the download zip option if the Git is not installed on the system.
3. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook opened in your browser, browse the cloned or downloaded folder and double click on Assignment4-100942268-Intro to Data.ipynb.
4. Run the steps of the code by either using the shift + enter option on the keyboard or by clicking the play button on the toolbar.

## Brief Code Explanation
### Installing 
Install these required libraries using pip
### Breakdown of Neural Network Classifier 
Uses MLPClassifier with the following parameters:  hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 4, 5)  activation='relu' solver='adam'  max_iter=10000  random_state=100 o Evaluates the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.
### Decision Tree Classifier
Uses DecisionTreeClassifier with random_state=100. Evaluates the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.
